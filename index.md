# [Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

Working with Python in Visual Studio Code, using the [Microsoft Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), is simple, fun, and productive. The extension makes VS Code an excellent IDE, and works on any operating system with a variety of Python interpreters. It leverages all of VS Code's power to provide auto complete and IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and unit testing, along with the ability to easily switch between Python environments, including virtual and conda environments.
